   abstract = {Molecular quantum simulations with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) rely on ansatz states that approximate the molecular ground states. These ansatz states are generally defined by parametrized fermionic excitation operators and an initial reference state. Efficient ways to perform fermionic excitations are vital for the realization of the VQE on noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers. Here, we address this issue by first demonstrating circuits that perform qubit excitations, excitations that do not account for fermionic anticommutation relations. We then extend the functionality of these circuits to perform fermionic excitations. Compared to circuits constructed with the standard use of "CNOT staircases", our circuits offer a linear reduction in the number of CNOT gates, by a factor of 2 (8) per single (double) qubit or fermionic excitation, respectively. Our results reduce the requirements for near-term realizations of quantum molecular simulations.},

   abstract = {We introduce a unitary coupled-cluster (UCC) ansatz termed k-UpCCGSD that is based on a family of sparse generalized doubles operators, which provides an affordable and systematically improvable unitary coupled-cluster wave function suitable for implementation on a near-term quantum computer. k-UpCCGSD employs k products of the exponential of pair coupled-cluster double excitation operators (pCCD), together with generalized single excitation operators. We compare its performance in both efficiency of implementation and accuracy with that of the generalized UCC ansatz employing the full generalized single and double excitation operators (UCCGSD), as well as with the standard ansatz employing only single and double excitations (UCCSD). k-UpCCGSD is found to show the best scaling for quantum computing applications, requiring a circuit depth of O(kN), compared with O(N3) for UCCGSD, and O((N-η)2η) for UCCSD, where N is the number of spin orbitals and η is the number of electrons. We analyzed the accuracy of these three ansätze by making classical benchmark calculations on the ground state and the first excited state of H 4 (STO-3G, 6-31G), H 2 O (STO-3G), and N 2 (STO-3G), making additional comparisons to conventional coupled cluster methods. The results for ground states show that k-UpCCGSD offers a good trade-off between accuracy and cost, achieving chemical accuracy for lower cost of implementation on quantum computers than both UCCGSD and UCCSD. UCCGSD is also found to be more accurate than UCCSD but at a greater cost for implementation. Excited states are calculated with an orthogonally constrained variational quantum eigensolver approach. This is seen to generally yield less accurate energies than for the corresponding ground states. We demonstrate that using a specialized multideterminantal reference state constructed from classical linear response calculations allows these excited state energetics to be improved.},

   abstract = {We present a review of the Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) ansatz and related ansätze which are used to variationally solve the electronic structure problem on quantum computers. A brief history of coupled cluster (CC) methods is provided, followed by a broad discussion of the formulation of CC theory. This includes touching on the merits and difficulties of the method and several variants, UCC among them, in the classical context, to motivate their applications on quantum computers. In the core of the text, the UCC ansatz and its implementation on a quantum computer are discussed at length, in addition to a discussion on several derived and related ansätze specific to quantum computing. The review concludes with a unified perspective on the discussed ansätze, attempting to bring them under a common framework, as well as with a reflection upon open problems within the field.},

   abstract = {Doubly occupied configuration interaction (DOCI) with optimized orbitals often accurately describes strong correlations while working in a Hilbert space much smaller than that needed for full configuration interaction. However, the scaling of such calculations remains combinatorial with system size. Pair coupled cluster doubles (pCCD) is very successful in reproducing DOCI energetically, but can do so with low polynomial scaling (N3, disregarding the two-electron integral transformation from atomic to molecular orbitals). We show here several examples illustrating the success of pCCD in reproducing both the DOCI energy and wave function and show how this success frequently comes about. What DOCI and pCCD lack are an effective treatment of dynamic correlations, which we here add by including higher-seniority cluster amplitudes which are excluded from pCCD. This frozen pair coupled cluster approach is comparable in cost to traditional closed-shell coupled cluster methods with results that are competitive for weakly correlated systems and often superior for the description of strongly correlated systems.},

   abstract = {Over the last century, a large number of physical and mathematical developments paired with rapidly advancing technology have allowed the field of quantum chemistry to advance dramatically. However, the lack of computationally efficient methods for the exact simulation of quantum systems on classical computers presents a limitation of current computational approaches. We report, in detail, how a set of pre-computed molecular integrals can be used to explicitly create a quantum circuit, i.e. a sequence of elementary quantum operations, that, when run on a quantum computer, obtains the energy of a molecular system with fixed nuclear geometry using the quantum phase estimation algorithm. We extend several known results related to this idea and discuss the adiabatic state preparation procedure for preparing the input states used in the algorithm. With current and near future quantum devices in mind, we provide a complete example using the hydrogen molecule of how a chemical Hamiltonian can be simulated using a quantum computer. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

   abstract = {Quantum computers promise to efficiently solve important problems that are intractable on a conventional computer. For quantum systems, where the physical dimension grows exponentially, finding the eigenvalues of certain operators is one such intractable problem and remains a fundamental challenge. The quantum phase estimation algorithm efficiently finds the eigenvalue of a given eigenvector but requires fully coherent evolution. Here we present an alternative approach that greatly reduces the requirements for coherent evolution and combine this method with a new approach to state preparation based on ansätze and classical optimization. We implement the algorithm by combining a highly reconfigurable photonic quantum processor with a conventional computer. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with an example from quantum chemistry - calculating the ground-state molecular energy for He-H+. The proposed approach drastically reduces the coherence time requirements, enhancing the potential of quantum resources available today and in the near future. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In stark contrast to other approaches, the wave function is an antisymmetric product of nonorthogonal geminals, but the geminals are structured so the projected Schrödinger equation can be solved very efficiently. We focus on an approach where, in each geminal, only one of the orbitals in a reference Slater determinant is occupied. The resulting method gives good results for atoms and small molecules. It also performs well for a prototypical example of strongly correlated electronic systems, the hydrogen atom chain. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {Coupled cluster theory with single and double excitations accurately describes weak electron correlation but is known to fail in cases of strong static correlation. Fascinatingly, however, pair coupled cluster doubles (p-CCD), a simplified version of the theory limited to pair excitations that preserve the seniority of the reference determinant (i.e., the number of unpaired electrons), has mean field computational cost and is an excellent approximation to the full configuration interaction (FCI) of the paired space provided that the orbital basis defining the pairing scheme is adequately optimized. In previous work, we have shown that optimization of the pairing scheme in the seniority zero FCI leads to a very accurate description of static correlation. The same conclusion extends to p-CCD if the orbitals are optimized to make the p-CCD energy stationary. We here demonstrate these results with numerous examples. We also explore the contributions of different seniority sectors to the coupled cluster doubles (CCD) correlation energy using different orbital bases. We consider both Hartree-Fock and Brueckner orbitals, and the role of orbital localization. We show how one can pair the orbitals so that the role of the Brueckner orbitals at the CCD level is retained at the p-CCD level. Moreover, we explore ways of extending CCD to accurately describe strongly correlated systems. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},
